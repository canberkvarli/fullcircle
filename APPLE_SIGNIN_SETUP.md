2. Select your project target (FullCircleDev)
3. Go to "Signing & Capabilities" tab
4. Click the "+" button to add capability
5. Search for "Sign In with Apple" and add it
6. This will automatically add the required entitlements

#### 2. Apple Developer Console Configuration

1. Go to [Apple Developer Console](https://developer.apple.com/account/)
2. Navigate to "Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles"
3. Select "Identifiers" and find your app identifier
4. Make sure "Sign In with Apple" capability is enabled
5. Configure the "Sign In with Apple" settings if needed

#### 3. Firebase Configuration

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project
3. Go to Authentication > Sign-in method
4. Enable "Apple" as a sign-in provider
5. Configure the Apple provider with your Apple Developer Team ID

#### 4. Rebuild the App

After making these changes:

```bash
# Clean and rebuild

cd ..
npx expo run:ios --clear
```

## Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ What's Working:
- Apple Sign-In function is properly implemented in UserContext
- SSO buttons component shows Apple Sign-In button on iOS
- Firebase integration is set up
- User data handling is implemented

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What Needs Manual Setup:
- Xcode project capabilities
- Apple Developer Console configuration
- Firebase Apple provider setup

## Debugging

The app now includes comprehensive logging for Apple Sign-In:

- Check console for "üçé Apple Sign-In Debug" messages
- Look for "üçé Apple Sign-In: Starting..." messages when you tap the button
- Check for any error messages in the console

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Apple Sign-In is not supported on this device"
**Solution**: Make sure you're testing on a real iOS device (not simulator) and the capability is properly added to Xcode.

### Issue: "Apple Sign-In failed - no identity token returned"
**Solution**: Check Apple Developer Console configuration and ensure the app has proper entitlements.

### Issue: Button not showing
**Solution**: The button only shows on iOS devices where `appleAuth.isSupported` returns true. Check the debug logs to see what's happening.

## Testing

1. **Use a real iOS device** - Apple Sign-In doesn't work in the iOS Simulator
2. **Check console logs** for debugging information
3. **Verify Firebase configuration** - make sure Apple provider is enabled
4. **Test with a real Apple ID** - you can't test with a simulator Apple ID

## Next Steps

1. Follow the manual setup steps above
2. Rebuild the app
3. Test on a real iOS device
4. Check console logs for any remaining issues
5. If still having problems, check the Firebase console for authentication errors
